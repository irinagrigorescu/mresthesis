abstract = {Echo-planar imaging is a fast magnetic resonance (MR) imaging technique that allows acquisition of single images in as little as 20 msec and performance of multiple-image studies in as little as 20 seconds. Echo-planar imaging achieves its speed by obtaining all spatial-encoding information after a single radio-frequency (RF) excitation. Conventional imaging requires multiple-RF excitations, separated by the repetition time (TR), to acquire this information. An "infinite" TR, routine lipid suppression, and sensitivity to magnetic susceptibility are other features of echo-planar imaging. Standard pulse sequences are used to obtain echo-planar images, which have diagnostic utility similar to that of conventional MR images. Echo-planar imaging is less sensitive to motion than is conventional MR imaging and allows imaging of rapidly changing physiologic processes such as blood flow and kinetic activity. Echo-planar imaging is opening new areas of MR imaging research and clinical applications.},

abstract = {A new method for rapid NMR imaging dubbed FLASH (fast low-angle shot) imaging is described which, for example, allows measuring times of the order of 1 s (64 ?? 128 pixel resolution) or 6 s (256 ?? 256 pixels). The technique takes advantage of excitation pulses with small flip angles eliminating the need of waiting periods in between successive experiments. It is based on the acquisition of the free induction decay in the form of a gradient echo generated by reversal of the read gradient. The entire imaging time is only given by the number of projections desired times the duration of slice selection and data acquisition. The method results in about a 100-fold reduction in measuring time without sacrificing spatial resolution. Further advantages are an optimized signal-to-noise ratio, the applicability of commercial gradient systems, and the deposition of extremely low rf power. FLASH imaging is demonstrated on phantoms, animals, and human extremities using a 2.3 T 40 cm bore magnet system. 1H NMR images are obtained with variable relaxation time contrasts and without motional artifacts. ?? 1986.},

abstract = {In this study a novel partially parallel acquisition method is presented, which can be used to accelerate image acquisition using an RF coil array for spatial encoding. In this technique, Parallel Imaging with Localized Sensitivities (PILS), it is assumed that the individual coils in the array have localized sensitivity patterns, in that their sensitivity is restricted to a finite region of space. Within the PILS model, a detailed, highly accurate RF field map is not needed prior to reconstruction. In PILS, each coil in the array is fully characterized by only two parameters: the center of coil's sensitive region in the FOV and the width of the sensitive region around this center. In this study, it is demonstrated that the incorporation of these coil parameters into a localized Fourier transform allows reconstruction of full FOV images in each of the component coils from data sets acquired with a reduced number of phase encoding steps compared to conventional imaging techniques. After the introduction of the PILS technique, primary focus is given to issues related to the practical implementation of PILS, including coil parameter determination and the SNR and artifact power in the resulting images. Finally, in vivo PILS images are shown which demonstrate the utility of the technique.},

abstract = {We describe methods for simultaneously acquiring and subsequently combining data from a multitude of closely positioned NMR receiving coils. The approach is conceptually similar to phased array radar and ultrasound and hence we call our techniques the "NMR phased array." The NMR phased array offers the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and resolution of a small surface coil over fields-of-view (FOV) normally associated with body imaging with no increase in imaging time. The NMR phased array can be applied to both imaging and spectroscopy for all pulse sequences. The problematic interactions among nearby surface coils is eliminated (a) by overlapping adjacent coils to give zero mutual inductance, hence zero interaction, and (b) by attaching low input impedance preamplifiers to all coils, thus eliminating interference among next nearest and more distant neighbors. We derive an algorithm for combining the data from the phased array elements to yield an image with optimum SNR. Other techniques which are easier to implement at the cost of lower SNR are explored. Phased array imaging is demonstrated with high resolution (512 x 512, 48-cm FOV, and 32-cm FOV) spin-echo images of the thoracic and lumbar spine. Data were acquired from four-element linear spine arrays, the first made of 12-cm square coils and the second made of 8-cm square coils. When compared with images from a single 15 x 30-cm rectangular coil and identical imaging parameters, the phased array yields a 2X and 3X higher SNR at the depth of the spine (approximately 7 cm).},

abstract = {Several aspects of blipped echo-planar imaging (EPI) are treated mathematically. An expression relating the necessary readout gradient strength and sampling time to the spatial resolution and readout duration is derived. It is shown how the net spatial resolution may be limited by the object's T2 characteristics and Bo field homogeneity, irrespective of the number of sampled points. Additionally, off-resonance effects result in a loss of spatial resolution and image distortion to a considerably greater degree than in conventional two-dimensional Fourier transform imaging. The extent of these effects is directly related to the time required to acquire the data matrix, and is therefore amplified when EPI is implemented on a standard commercial whole-body system which because of limited gradient performance uses necessarily longer sampling durations. Specific hardware modifications to a standard commercial imager are considered to allow successful EPI implementation. EPI image characteristics are compared quantitatively with those of conventional methods. {\textcopyright} 1990 Academic Press, Inc.},

Therefore, sshEPI was combined with SENSitivity Encoding (SENSE) to further increase EPI's potential for stroke imaging. Eight healthy volunteers and a consecutive series of patients (N = 8) with suspected stroke were examined with diffusion-weighted SENSE-sshEPI using different reduction factors (1.0 {\textless} or = R {\textless} or = 3.0). Additionally, a high-resolution diffusion-weighted SENSE-sshEPI scan was included. All examinations were diagnostic and of better quality than conventional sshEPI. No ghostings or aliasing artifacts were discernible, and EPI-related image distortions were markedly diminished. Chemical shift artifacts and eddy current-induced image warping were still present, although to a markedly smaller extent. Measured direction-dependent diffusion-coefficients and isotropic diffusion values were comparable to previous findings but showed less fluctuation. We have demonstrated the technical feasibility and clinical applicability of diffusion-weighted SENSE-sshEPI in patients with subacute stroke. Because of the faster k-space traversal, this novel technique is able to reduce typical EPI artifacts and increase spatial resolution while simultaneously remaining insensitive to bulk motion.},

@article{Griswold1999,
abstract = {Spatial resolution in single-shot imaging is limited by signal attenuation due to relaxation of transverse magnetization. This effect can be reduced by minimizing acquisition times through the use of short interecho spacings. However, the minimum interecho spacing is constrained by limits on gradient switching rates, radiofrequency (RF) power deposition and RF pulse length. Recently, simultaneous acquisition of spatial harmonics (SMASH) has been introduced as a method to acquire magnetic resonance images at increased speeds using a reduced number of phase-encoding gradient steps by extracting spatial information contained in an RF coil array. In this study, it is shown that SMASH can be used to reduce the effects of relaxation, resulting in single-shot images with increased spatial resolution without increasing imaging time. After a brief theoretical discussion, two strategies to reduce signal attenuation and increase spatial resolution in single-shot imaging are introduced and their performance is evaluated in phantom studies. In vivo single-shot echoplanar imaging (EPI), BURST, and half-Fourier single-shot turbo spin-echo (HASTE) images are then presented demonstrating the practical implementation of these resolution enhancement strategies. Images acquired with SMASH show increased spatial resolution and improved image quality when compared with images obtained with the conventional acquisitions. The general principles presented for imaging with SMASH can also be applied to other partially parallel imaging techniques.},

A time-normalized breath-hold task using a block design functional MRI protocol was carried out in combination with up to four echo trains per excitation and parallel imaging acceleration factors R = 1-3. Experiments were conducted in five human subjects, each scanned in three sessions. Across all reduction factors, both signal-to-fluctuation-noise ratio and the total number of activated voxels were significantly lower using a single-echo EPI pulse sequence compared with the multiecho approach. Signal-to-fluctuation-noise ratio and total number of activated voxels were also considerably reduced for nonaccelerated conventional single-echo EPI when compared to three-echo measurements with R = 2. Parallel imaging accelerated multiecho EPI reduced geometric distortions and signal dropout, while it increased blood-oxygenation-level-dependent signal sensitivity all over the brain, particularly in regions with short underlying T*(2).

Thus, by using multiple receiver coils in parallel scan time in Fourier imaging can be considerably reduced. The problem of image reconstruction from sensitivity encoded data is formulated in a general fashion and solved for arbitrary coil configurations and k-space sampling patterns. Special attention is given to the currently most practical case, namely, sampling a common Cartesian grid with reduced density. For this case the feasibility of the proposed methods was verified both in vitro and in vivo. Scan time was reduced to one-half using a two-coil array in brain imaging.

Unlike standard Fourier MRI, SENSE images exhibit an inhomogeneous noise distribution, which crucially depends on the geometrical sensitivity relations of the coils used. Thus, for optimum signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) and noise homogeneity, specialized coil configurations are called for. In this article we study the implications of SENSE imaging for coil layout by means of simulations and imaging experiments in a phantom and in vivo. New, specific design principles are identified. For SENSE imaging, the elements of a coil array should be smaller than for common phased-array imaging. Furthermore, adjacent coil elements should not overlap. Based on the findings of initial investigations, a configuration of six coils was designed and built specifically for cardiac applications.

The dependence of the ultimate intrinsic SNR on a variety of experimental conditions is explored and a physically intuitive explanation for the observed behavior is provided based on a comparison between the electromagnetic wavelength and the distance between aliasing points. Imaging at high field strength, with correspondingly short wavelength, is shown to offer advantages for parallel imaging beyond those already expected due to the larger available spin polarization. One-dimensional undersampling of k-space yields a steep drop in attainable SNR for more than a 5-fold reduction of scan time, while 2D undersampling permits access to much higher degrees of acceleration. Increased tissue conductivity decreases baseline SNR, but improves parallel imaging performance.

In addition, the more explicit spatial information embedded in the phase of the Signals from the strip array is advantageous (compared to loop arrays) for limiting aliasing artifacts in parallel MRI. However, losses in the detector as its natural resonance frequency approaches the Larmor frequency (where the wavelength is long at 1.5 T) may limit the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the PSA. Moreover, the PSA's inherent lambda/4 structure severely limits our ability to adjust detector geometry to optimize the performance for a specific organ system, as is done with loop coils. In this study we replaced the dielectric substrate with discrete capacitors, which resulted in both SNR improvement and a tunable lumped-element PSA (LPSA) whose dimensions can be optimized within broad constraints, for a given region of interest (ROI) and MRI frequency. A detailed theoretical analysis of the LPSA is presented, including its equivalent circuit, electromagnetic fields, SNR, and g-factor maps for parallel MRI. Two different decoupling schemes for the LPSA are described.

Parallel imaging works by acquiring a reduced amount of k-space data with an array of receiver coils. These undersampled data can be acquired more quickly, but the undersampling leads to aliased images. One of several parallel imaging algorithms can then be used to reconstruct artifact-free images from either the aliased images (SENSE-type reconstruction) or from the undersampled data (GRAPPA-type reconstruction). The advantages of parallel imaging in a clinical setting include faster image acquisition, which can be used, for instance, to shorten breath-hold times resulting in fewer motion-corrupted examinations. In this article the basic concepts behind parallel imaging are introduced. The relationship between undersampling and aliasing is discussed and two commonly used parallel imaging methods, SENSE and GRAPPA, are explained in detail. Examples of artifacts arising from parallel imaging are shown and ways to detect and mitigate these artifacts are described.

The aim was to develop a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) simulator that makes no assumptions with respect to the underlying pulse sequence and also allows for complex large-scale analysis on a single computer without requiring simplifications of the MRI model. We hypothesized that such a simulation platform could be developed with parallel acceleration of the executable core within the graphic processing unit (GPU) environment. MRISIMUL integrates realistic aspects of the MRI experiment from signal generation to image formation and solves the entire complex problem for densely spaced isochromats and for a densely spaced time axis. The simulation platform was developed in MATLAB whereas the computationally demanding core services were developed in CUDA-C. The MRISIMUL simulator imaged three different computer models: a user-defined phantom, a human brain model and a human heart model. The high computational power of GPU-based simulations was compared against other computer configurations. A speedup of about 228 times was achieved when compared to serially executed C-code on the CPU whereas a speedup between 31 to 115 times was achieved when compared to the OpenMP parallel executed C-code on the CPU, depending on the number of threads used in multithreading (2-8 threads). The high performance of MRISIMUL allows its application in large-scale analysis and can bring the computational power of a supercomputer or a large computer cluster to a single GPU personal computer.},

abstract = {This paper gives an overview of SIMRI, a new 3D MRI simulator based on the Bloch equation. This simulator proposes an efficient management of the T*2 effect, and in a unique simulator integrates most of the simulation features that are offered in different simulators. It takes into account the main static field value and enables realistic simulations of the chemical shift artifact, including off-resonance phenomena. It also simulates the artifacts linked to the static field inhomogeneity like those induced by susceptibility variation within an object. It is implemented in the C language and the MRI sequence programming is done using high level C functions with a simple programming interface. To manage large simulations, the magnetization kernel is implemented in a parallelized way that enables simulation on PC grid architecture. Furthermore, this simulator includes a 1D interactive interface for pedagogic purpose illustrating the magnetization vector motion as well as the MRI contrasts. ?? 2004 Elsevier Inc.

@article{Hacklander2005,
abstract = {The aim of this project was to simulate the features and functions of a clinical or real-world MR scanner on a personal computer by means of a computer program. The users should be able to change all relevant settings of the virtual scanner and adapt them to the expected pathology. The algorithms of the simulation are based on parameter images of the three physical basic properties T1, T2, and proton density. From this, the synthetic images are calculated pixel by pixel on the basis of the well-known formulas of the pulse sequences chosen and modified by the user. The graphical user interface is oriented to a real-world MR scanner. The software is programmed in pure Java and is freely available under the GPL license. Besides spin echo pulse sequence, 6 other pulse sequence classes are implemented. Parameters like repetition time and echo time can be adjusted. The choice of parameters like matrix size, slice-thickness, and number of acquisitions has an impact on the signal-to-noise ratio of the images. In a first step, the simulation calculates the signal intensity in k-space. Wraparound and motion artifacts are simulated by modifying the data of k-space. In a last step, a 2D-Fourier transform of k-space data is performed. As the image calculation takes only a few seconds, an interactive manner of working is possible. The simulation has been used in the education of medical students and interns for more than 1 year and has gained widespread acceptance. {\textcopyright} AUR, 2005.},

@article{Petersson1993,
abstract = {An MRI simulation method, together with a corresponding computer program, using the k-space formalism has been developed. It uses a FFT algorithm to generate the ideal NMR signal from a user defined object. The k-space trajectory given by a pulse sequence is calculated. And it is used to select elements from the ideal NMR signal. This selection of elements mimic the sampling of the signal in an actual MRI experiment. During the sampling procedure changes in signal amplitude due to relaxation and excitation are introduced as well as signal phase changes due to movement or flow. Artifacts due to stimulated echoes and transversal magnetization that propagate through several repetition periods are also handled. The usefulness of the method is demonstrated by calculations using standard spin-echo sequence as well as modifications introduced in order to generate angiographical images and flow phase images. Further more a fast pulse sequence, echo planar imaging (EPI), is also simulated. The method is faster than previously presented ones. It is capable of generating images (128 × 128 matrix), including more than eight different T1 and T2 combinations, in less than 3 min on a standard 386 387 type IBM compatible PC. {\textcopyright} 1993.},

To test the validity of this program, we have simulated some well-known experimental results. Some applications are presented which contribute to the understanding of image distortions and to techniques such as selective radio-frequency pulse or oscillating gradients. This program can be used to unravel physical and technological causes of image distortions, to have a "microscopic" look at any parameter of an experiment, and to study the contrast given by various NMR imaging techniques as a function of the three NMR parameters, i.e., the hydrogen nuclei density $\rho${\{}variant{\}} and the relaxation times T1 and T2. {\textcopyright} 1984.},

The accompanying computational burden is overcome by means of parallel computing. Many aspects are covered that have not hitherto been simultaneously investigated in general MRI simulations such as parallel transmit and receive, important off-resonance effects, nonlinear gradients, and arbitrary spatiotemporal parameter variations at different levels. The latter can be used to simulate various types of motion, for instance. The JEMRIS user interface is very simple to use, but nevertheless it presents few limitations. MRI sequences with arbitrary waveforms and complex interdependent modules are modeled in a graphical user interface-based environment requiring no further programming.

@article{Drobnjak2006,
abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) is a noninvasive method of imaging brain function in vivo. However, images produced in FMRI experiments are imperfect and contain several artifacts that contaminate the data. These artifacts include rigid-body motion effects, B0-field inhomogeneities, chemical shift, and eddy currents. To investigate these artifacts, with the eventual aim of minimizing or removing them completely, a computational model of the FMR image acquisition process was built that can simulate all of the above-mentioned artifacts. This paper gives an overview of the development of the FMRI simulator. The simulator uses the Bloch equations together with a geometric definition of the object (brain) and a varying T2* model for the BOLD activations. Furthermore, it simulates rigid-body motion of the object by solving Bloch equations for given motion parameters that are defined for an object moving continuously in time, including during the read-out period, which is a novel approach in the area of MRI computer simulations. With this approach it is possible, in a controlled and precise way, to simulate the full effects of various rigid-body motion artifacts in FMRI data (e.g. spin-history effects, B0-motion interaction, and within-scan motion blurring) and therefore formulate and test algorithms for their reduction.},

It is on the verge of widespread application in diagnosis of cardiovascular disease and in image guided surgery. While permanent and resistive magnets are used for low field applications ({\&}ldquo;open{\&}rdquo; MRI) most systems use high field superconducting magnets making MRI the largest commercial application of superconductivity. The MRI magnet is the largest and most expensive component in the MRI system. Magnet configuration is the determining factor in MRI system architecture and directly connected to issues such as patient comfort, ease of siting, life cycle cost and functionality. All of these factors drive magnet requirements. Thus, MRI magnet requirements are determined by a combination of MRI system needs, technical requirements and market forces, plus the need for continuous reduction of both magnet-acquisition cost and total cost of ownership. Cost of ownership, in turn, includes siting, installation, operation and service.

@article{Hidalgo-Tobon2010,
abstract = {The process to produce an MR image includes nuclear alignment, RF excitation, spatial encoding, and image formation. In simple terms, an magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) system consists of five major components: a magnet, gradient systems, an RF coil system, a receiver, and a computer system. To form an image, it is necessary to perform spatial localization of the MR signals, which is achieved using gradient coils. In modern MRI, gradient coils able to generate high gradient strengths and slew rates are required to produce high imaging speeds and improved image quality. MRI also requires the use of gradient coils that generate magnetic fields, which vary linearly with position over the imaging volume. Gradient coils for MRI must therefore have high current efficiency (defined as the ratio of gradient generated to current drawn), short switching time (i.e., low inductance), gradient linearity over a large volume, low power consumption, and minimal interaction with any other equipment, which would otherwise result in eddy currents. Over the last two decades new methods of gradient coil design have been developed, and a combination of these methods can be a mixture of them trying to avoid discomforts to patients that at the end is the center of all the technological efforts in the art of MRI. {\textcopyright} 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

@article{Yoder2004,
abstract = {A new MRI simulator has been developed that generates images of realistic objects for arbitrary pulse sequences executed in the presence of static field inhomogeneities, including those due to magnetic susceptibility, variations in the applied field, and chemical shift. In contrast to previous simulators, this system generates object-specific inhomogeneity patterns from first principles and propagates the consequent frequency offsets and intravoxel dephasing through the acquisition protocols to produce images with realistic artifacts. The simulator consists of two parts. The input to part 1 is a set of "susceptibility voxels" that describe the magnetic properties of the object being imaged. It calculates a frequency offset for each voxel by computing the size of the static field offset at each voxel in the image based on the magnetic susceptibility of each tissue type within all voxels. The method of calculation is a three-dimensional convolution of the susceptibility-voxels with a kernel derived from a previously published method and takes advantage of the superposition principle to include voxels with mixtures of substances of differing susceptibilities. Part 2 produces both a signal and a reconstructed image. Its inputs include a voxel-based description of the object, frequency offsets computed by part 1, applied static field errors, chemical shift values, and a description of the imaging protocol. Intravoxel variations in both static field and time-dependent phase are calculated for each voxel. Validations of part 1 are presented for a known analytic solution and for experimental data from two phantoms. Part 2 was validated with comparisons to an independent simulation provided by the Montreal Neurological Institute and experimental data from a phantom. ?? 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

To address this issue, we have developed a system to simulate MRI cluster plots using multicompartmental anthropomorphic software models of anatomy, and components for image contrast, signal-to-noise ratio, image nonuniformity, tissue heterogeneity, imager field strength, the partial volume effect, correlation between proton density, T1 and T2, and a variety of data preprocessing techniques.

The simulation allows an informed choice of pulse sequence, acquisition parameters, and data preprocessing for cluster classification to be made as well as providing an aid to interpretation of acquired data cluster plots and a valuable educational tool.

Subjectively, the quality of synthetic and acquired images is comparable. It is shown quantitatively for several tissue types that the reconstructed synthetic signal matches the acquired signal within the uncertainty of the acquired images. Observed and measured noise levels in the acquired and synthetic images are comparable. Because of a signal-averaging effect, the synthetic images can have a higher signal-to-noise ratio than the source images, thereby providing improved boundary definition.

The large possible number of imaging techniques and range of variable parameters for each make it difficult to perform exhaustive evaluations in a single patient or even in animal models. In addition, changes in operating magnetic field strength change the relaxation times sufficiently so that the efficacy of a technique at a given field does not imply similar results at another field value. Tools are demonstrated that permit the evaluation of the efficacy of any model of response to tissue parameters, and also allow the investigation of the effects of changing magnetic field. Global maps of signal difference between tissues as well as calculated images are obtainable from a minimally sufficient data set. These tools serve as an important adjunct to experimental work.},

abstract = {The application of parallel magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is increasing as clinicians continue to strive for improved spatial and temporal resolution, benefits that arise from the use of fewer phase encodings during imaging. To reconstruct images, extra information is needed to map the spatial sensitivity of each coil element, which may be accomplished by acquiring a calibration image in one common implementation of parallel MR imaging. Although obtaining a quick calibration image is an efficient method for gathering this information, corruption of the image or disharmony with subsequent images may lead to errors in reconstruction. Although conventional MR imaging sequences may be employed with parallel MR imaging, the altered image reconstruction introduces several new artifacts and changes the appearance of conventional artifacts. The altered appearance of traditional artifacts may obscure the source of the problem, and, in some cases, the severity of artifacts associated with parallel MR imaging may be exacerbated, hindering image interpretation. Several artifacts arise in the context of parallel MR imaging, including both traditional artifacts and those associated with parallel MR imaging.},

Although reduction of some artifacts may require a service engineer, the radiologist has the responsibility to recognize MR imaging problems. The radiologist's knowledge of MR imaging artifacts is important to the continued maintenance of high image quality and is essential if one is to avoid confusing artifactual appearances with pathology.},

@article{Drobnjak2010,
abstract = {Transient magnetic fields induce changes in magnetic resonance (MR) images ranging from small, visually undetectable effects (caused, for instance, by neuronal currents) to more significant ones, such as those created by the gradient fields and eddy currents. Accurately simulating these effects may assist in correcting or optimising MR imaging for many applications (e.g., diffusion imaging, current density imaging, use of magnetic contrast agents, neuronal current imaging, etc.). Here we have extended an existing MR simulator (POSSUM) with a model for changing magnetic fields at a very high-resolution time-scale. This simulator captures a realistic range of scanner and physiological artifacts by modeling the scanner environment, pulse sequence details and subject properties (e.g., brain geometry and air-tissue boundaries).The simulations were validated by using previously published experimental data sets. In the first dataset a transient magnetic field was produced by a single conducting wire with varying current amplitude (between 17 ??A and 765 ??A). The second was identical except that current amplitude was fixed (at 7.8 mA) and current timing varied. A very close match between simulated images and experimental data was observed. In addition, these validation results led to the observation that the current-induced effects included ringing in the image, which extended away from the conductor, primarily in the phase-encode direction. This effect had previously not been noticed in the noisy, experimentally-acquired images, demonstrating one way in which simulated images can provide potential insight into imaging experiments. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

@article{Cocosco1996,
abstract = {Introduction The increased importance of automated computer techniques for anatomical brain mapping from MR images and quantitative brain image analysis methods leads to an increased need for validation and evaluation of the effect of image acquisition parameters on performance of these procedures. Validation of analysis techniques of in-vivo acquired images is complicated due to the lack of reference data ("ground truth"). Also, optimal selection of the MR imaging parameters is difficult due to the large parameter space. BrainWeb makes available to the neuroimaging community, on-line on WWW, a set of realistic simulated brain MR image volumes (Simulated Brain Database, SBD) that allows the above issues to be examined in a controlled, systematic way. Features The SBD was generated by varying specific imaging parameters in an MRI simulator, which starts from a digital phantom, and performs a realistic, first-principles modeling of the imaging process based on},

@article{Collins1998,
abstract = {After conception and implementation of any new medical image processing algorithm, validation is an important step to ensure that the procedure fulfills all requirements set forth at the initial design stage. Although the algorithm must be evaluated on real data, a comprehensive validation requires the additional use of simulated data since it is impossible to establish ground truth with in vivo data. Experiments with simulated data permit controlled evaluation over a wide range of conditions (e.g., different levels of noise, contrast, intensity artefacts, or geometric distortion). Such considerations have become increasingly important with the rapid growth of neuroimaging, i.e., computational analysis of brain structure and function using brain scanning methods such as positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. Since simple objects such as ellipsoids or parallelepipedes do not reflect the complexity of natural brain anatomy, we present the design and creation of a realistic, high-resolution, digital, volumetric phantom of the human brain. This three-dimensional digital brain phantom is made up of ten volumetric data sets that define the spatial distribution for different tissues (e.g., grey matter, white matter, muscle, skin, etc.), where voxel intensity is proportional to the fraction of tissue within the voxel. The digital brain phantom can be used to simulate tomographic images of the head. Since the contribution of each tissue type to each voxel in the brain phantom is known, it can be used as the gold standard to test analysis algorithms such as classification procedures which seek to identify the tissue "type" of each image voxel. Furthermore, since the same anatomical phantom may be used to drive simulators for different modalities, it is the ideal tool to test intermodality registration algorithms. The brain phantom and simulated MR images have been made publicly available on the Internet (http://www.bic.mni.mcgill.ca/brainweb).},
